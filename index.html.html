    <section>
        <h2>Future Treatment Methods To Look For</h2>
        <img src="css.jpeg" alt="Future Waste Water Treatment Innovations" height="250">
        <p>The field of waste water treatment is continually evolving to address emerging challenges such as increasing pollution levels, stringent regulatory standards, water scarcity, and the need for sustainable and resource efficient solutions.
           <br >They are expected to integrate advanced technologies, enhance resource recovery , improve energy efficiency,and adopt sustainable practices</p>
        <p><b>Types of Methods:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sono Arsenic Filtering:</b>Arsenic contamination in water is a significant environmentaland public health concern globally. Effective arsenic filtering is essential to ensure safe drinking water, protect ecosystems, and comply with regulatory standards. the term"SONO ARSENIC FILTERING" likely refers to sono-based(sonochemical or ultrasound-assisted) methods for arsenic removal.</li>
            <li><b>Lifestraw:</b>LifeStraw functions by sucking water through the straw-like device, which has an internal filtration system. The hollow fiber membrane traps contaminants, allowing only clean water to pass through. This makes it effective in filtering out harmful microorganisms from rivers, lakes, and other water sources.</li>
            <li><b>Ultraviolet Irradiation:</b>Ultraviolet (UV) Irradiation Technology is a widely recognized and effective method for disinfecting water and wastewater by inactivating harmful microorganisms. Leveraging the germicidal properties of UV light, this technology has become an integral component of modern water treatment systems, ensuring the safety and quality of water for various applications. This comprehensive overview explores the principles, mechanisms, applications, advantages, limitations, and future advancements of UV irradiation technology in water and wastewater treatment</li>
            <li><b>Membrane Filtration Technology:</b> Membrane Filtration Technology is a process used in water and wastewater treatment to separate contaminants and particles from water by using a semi-permeable membrane. The technology is based on the principle that water, and some dissolved substances, can pass through the membrane's tiny pores, while other contaminants such as suspended solids, bacteria, and larger molecules are retained. Membrane filtration is widely applied in industrial, municipal, and drinking water treatment processes due to its efficiency and versatility.</li>
            <li><b>Desalination:</b> Desalination is the process of removing salts and other dissolved minerals from seawater or brackish water to produce fresh water that is suitable for human consumption, irrigation, or industrial use. With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world, desalination has emerged as a crucial technology for providing a reliable source of clean water. This process is especially important in arid and semi-arid regions where natural freshwater supplies are limited.</li>
